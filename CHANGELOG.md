### Changed

- Games now run inside a tab in VS Code instead of opening a browser window. (Courtesy Carey Williams).

## [3.0.0] - 2024-03-10

While this version includes minor functional changes, the underlying structure has been extensively re-worked to move it towards being a web extension, which is why we're bumping the major version number.

### Added

- Stats can now be generated and saved.

- Updated Choicescript to latest version (d8d1680).

### Fixed

- Missing choices no longer make document symbols vanish.
- Variables whose name includes `param_count` (but are _not_ `param_count` itself) are now tracked properly.
- `*text_image` is now parsed properly.
- Only the first `startup.txt` file in the project will be indexed. (You shouldn't have multiples of them anyway, but just in case...)

### Added

- Ability to turn on showing text for only parts of a randomtest run using `*comment text off` and `*comment text on`.

Point release to fix an issue with the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## [2.5.0] - 2022-01-22

- A new setting allows you to turn off warnings when your game doesn't follow Choice of Games's in-house style guide (like using ellipses and limiting option length to 15 words).

### Changed

- Re-ordered randomtest options in the context menu.
- The extension doesn't get bogged down like it used to on 30k+ word chapters.

### Fixed

- The extension now indexes all scenes referenced anywhere in the game, not just scenes listed in the `*scene_list`.

- Fixed numerous problems with variables defined in subroutines being flagged as used before they were defined.

## [2.3.0] - 2021-08-14

### Added

- You can now re-run Randomtest using the previous run's settings, to make it easier to repeat Randomtest runs with custom settings.
- By default, each Randomtest run that captures output saves it to a unique document. A new setting lets you save results to the same document so it's easier to make changes to your game, re-run Randomtest, and immediately see the results.

### Fixed

- `modulo` is now correctly identified as a numeric operator.
- In an `#option` line with a `*hide_reuse` (or similar reuse variable) and an `*if` statement that references a variable, that reference is no longer mis-located.

- Fixed syntax highlighting to properly color comments, commands, and other similar items inside italic or bold markup.
- Improved Quicktest error message handling to properly identify what file the error occurred in.

## [2.2.0] - 2021-06-12

## [2.1.0] - 2021-04-25

### Changed

- When running Quicktest or Randomtest, all open files are saved so that your latest code is used.
- Better error messages for using negative numbers in comparisons (like `*if var < -2`), which aren't allowed.

### Fixed
